//This program takes the user's name and greets them. It uses a method to animate a face to give the user a better experience. 
//Peer Review: Jeremy lapham. Great program very creative. The faces were really cool and the code was super clean.


//Initializes the various variables in the main method of the program. 
//This is where the parts of the face that change are stored.
